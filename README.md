# University graduation/dropout Predictions
 
# Project Description

Not everyone goes to college and not everyone who goes finished either. An observational study was conducted on university students in europe to gather data about students who graduated and/or dropped out. The purpose of this project is to analyze this data and come up with a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a student with graduate.

# Project Goal
 
* Discover features that have the strongest influence on graduation.

* Use features to develop a machine learning model to predict graduation.

* This information can be used to identify students who are at risk of dropping out and providing them with additional resources/services.
 
# Initial Thoughts
 
My initial informal hypothesis is that nationality will have no influence, age will have no influence, and parent education level with have an influence on graduation.
 
# The Plan
 
* Aquire data from kaggle.com

   * Create Engineered columns from existing data:

       * marital status
       * course
       * daytime/evening classes
       * previous qualification
       * nationality
       * mother's qualification
       * father's qualification
       * mother's occupation
       * father's occupation
       * sulphates
       * educational special needs
       * tuition fees up to data
       * gender
       * scholarship holder
       * age at enrollment
       * target
 
* Explore data in search of drivers of graduation
